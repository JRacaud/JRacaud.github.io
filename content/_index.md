Welcome to my humble space on the internet where I experiment with new technologies and ideas.

I'm keeping here [Articles](/articles) and [Snippets](/snippets) of code on various programing topics. So basically building my own knowledge library.

You might wonder (most likely not) why separating articles and snippets. After all, they are kind of the same thing. You know, written text about... technical... stuff.

Well, the [Articles](/articles) section is a more traditional blog with, dum duuum DUUUUUM!!! articles that can range on a lot of different topics. 
* Sharing news about ``foo``.
* Making a tutorial on ``bar``.
* Or why I'm programming with beef

Even though the primary focus is programming, you may find articles about technology in general (or more... :wink: :wink:).

Whereas the [Snippets](snippets) section really has one goal: Being the [tick-tock|youtube shorts|vine|or whatnot] of programming in written form. So bite-size snippets that go straight to the point:

* What's its name/What does it do?
* How to write it?
* How to use it?
* Some ex👏pla👏na👏tion 👏please.

No more do we have to struggle through reading long-winded articles with 30 pages of context before actually seeing the code we were **NOT** looking for. Of course, the primary audience is yours truly, but I hope that other crying souls in search of enlightenment can find helpful aid in this digital land.
