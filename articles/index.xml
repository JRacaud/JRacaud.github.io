I started working on my own programming language.
How it started I stubbled upon the Crafting Interpreters book and found it very interesting to read. As I never really studied compilers and how they worked, the approach of this book, which is writting a full fledge interpreter for a simple programming language, was very interesting to me.
I am more of a hands on kind of guy when it comes to learning, so that approach was perfect for me.</description></item><item><title>Discovering Hugo</title><link>https://jracaud.com/articles/discovering_hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jracaud.com/articles/discovering_hugo/</guid><description>So I decided to go with the static website generator called Hugo for building my blog. My first impression is that it is a good static site generator so far.
It is written in Go, and for what I used of it, it is quite fast. Being accustomed to PHP static site generators, having the hot-reload code generation being fast was quite surprising in a good way.
Alas, there&amp;rsquo;s one issue: it runs code inside of comments.</description></item></channel></rss>
